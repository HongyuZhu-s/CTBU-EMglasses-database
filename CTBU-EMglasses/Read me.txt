This dataset comprises eye movement data from 203 volunteers, collected using the Tobii Pro Glasses 3. 
The term 'Dynamic' indicates that the participants' heads were not fixed in place during sampling, and the viewed materials were also not stationary.

Subfiles within the dataset are named according to the following format: 'Number'-d-'Number of samples'.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. 
Additionally, it is recommended that you consult Tobii's user manual as well as the paper titled 'EmMixformer: Mix Transformer for Eye Movement Recognition'.

If you utilize this dataset in your research, we kindly ask that you cite 'EmMixformer' in your publications. Thank you for your cooperation!
