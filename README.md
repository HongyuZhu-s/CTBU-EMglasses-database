# 👏 CTBU-EMglasses-Database 
A low frequency eye fixation point movement database using **Tobii Pro Glasses 3 Eye tracker**. Contains **203 classes**, each classes contains 2 10-second videos at 50 frames per second (**about 10 * 50 sample signals**), two videos from two acquisition cycles.  Specifically, participants were asked to watch video material used to stimulate vision **twice**, in the form of random points displayed on a tablet.
